# Les Chroniques Héroiques #

Les Chroniques Héroiques is a website design to support your tabletop RPG campaign, whether it's online or around a table. It provides a quest and scenario handler, as well as visual representation for terrain with both a "world map" and proceduraly generated "hexmaps".

**Using the project**

You can start a campaign or join a new one, create your character, and start the adventure as a DM, or a player. You Land on the worldMap, and from there you're free to explore and play as a regular tabletop game.

You can create characters if you're a player and even you own class, stats and everything in between.
Craft your own adventure as a DM, from quests to overall scenario with NPCs.

A dice manager is implemented along the battlemaps to help you in those social-distant context.

This website is meant as a support for your campaigns rather than a game but we'll be adding character 3D figures, 3D dices and multiple worldmaps in the future to provide an even better and complete experience for you and your fellow players.
